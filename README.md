# The Guardian

### ASME UCLA X1 Robotics Project, 2018-2019

This year, X1 Robotics is tackling a project dear to video game fans around the world: a Guardian from Nintendo Entertainment's Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The project, an interactive Hexapod with a rotating head, will be a unique challenge X1 has yet to attempt. The Guardian will feature target tracking, a life-like gait, organic behavior, and a laser pointer "turret" capable of following its target. The project is scheduled for completion in Spring 2019.
