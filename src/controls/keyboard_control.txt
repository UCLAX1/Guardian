Given a leg object, the keyboard control should achieve:

If pressing "W", the leg should continuously move according to 
the internal stored path and current heading, until "W" is released.
A small time delay between each path point is not necessary because 
the inverse kinematic takes a non-trivial amount of time.

Should involve leg.step()



If pressing "A" or "D", the heading of the leg should turn counterclockwise
and clockwise, respectively. The turn should be in a slow controlled manner,
for instance, for every 3 seconds the button is pressed, the leg should turn 
about 90 degrees.

Should involve leg.turn() and some timing.



If pressing "S", the leg should continuously move backwards according to 
the internal stored path and current heading, opposite to the motion 
when pressing "W".

Can be accomplished by turning 180 degrees then using step like normal
